During my time as the lead-front end develoepr at Speakable.org, I was charged with building new products, product features, internal tools, and company websites [[A](https://actionbutton.org/), [B](https://speakable.org/)].
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Action Button, my contriubtions improved upon existing codebase by reducing bundle size ~25%, limiting API usage, as well as increasing performance and user engagement. By developing highly-interactive and UX-focused experiences, we were able to increase our user interaction 10-20x.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional aspects of my work during my time at Speakable, which still remain private from the pubic, may be made available upon request.
